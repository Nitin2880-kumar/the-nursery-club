                       in court in case of any disputes.Jurisdiction in case of online transactions is a developing area in India. 
This is so because a website can be accessed anywhere in India and thus, as per the cases decided till now, a plaintiff can institute
the suit anywhere he wants. However, in some recent cases, judges have held that a court will have territorial jurisdiction to decide on.
